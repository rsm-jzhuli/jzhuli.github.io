    "section": "",
    "text": "Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the American Economic Review in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the AEA website and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of Harvard‚Äôs Dataverse.\nTo fully appreciate the importance and implications of this work, it is useful to examine the broader context in which the study was conducted, as well as the experimental methodology and key findings that emerged.\nIn the field of charitable fundraising, a persistent challenge faced by organizations is determining the most effective strategies to encourage donations. Historically, private giving in the United States has been robust, frequently surpassing 2% of GDP; however, fundraising practices have traditionally been guided more by anecdotal experiences and conventional wisdom rather than by rigorous empirical evidence. To address this gap, economists Dean Karlan (Yale University) and John List (University of Chicago) executed a pioneering field experiment aimed at empirically examining whether and how the ‚Äúprice‚Äù of giving influences charitable contributions.\nKarlan and List‚Äôs research specifically focused on the ‚Äúdemand side‚Äù of charitable donations, an area notably under-explored relative to the tax-driven ‚Äúsupply side‚Äù incentives. The core research question guiding their investigation was whether reducing the effective cost of charitable donations through matching grants could successfully increase donor contributions. To empirically test this question, the researchers collaborated with a liberal nonprofit organization in the United States, utilizing a sample of 50,083 prior donors. These individuals were randomly assigned into two primary groups: approximately one-third constituted the control group, receiving a standard four-page fundraising letter, while the remaining two-thirds formed the treatment group, receiving a similar letter that prominently included an offer of a matching grant.\nWithin the treatment group, further randomization led to the creation of specific sub-conditions. These conditions varied by matching ratios (1:1, 2:1, or 3:1), maximum match amounts ($25,000, $50,000, $100,000, or an unspecified cap), and suggested donation amounts relative to donors‚Äô previous contributions (100%, 125%, or 150%). The fundraising letters, distributed in August 2005, strategically referenced contemporary political events, specifically Supreme Court nominations, to ensure the real-world relevance and external validity of the study.\nThe results of Karlan and List‚Äôs experiment revealed compelling evidence regarding the efficacy of matching grants. The simple presence of a matching offer increased both the response rate by 22% and revenue per solicitation by 19%. Interestingly, however, increasing the match ratio beyond 1:1 to ratios of 2:1 or 3:1 yielded no additional incremental benefit. The findings suggest that the matching grants may have primarily acted as signals of credibility and urgency, leveraging social cues embedded in the framing of the match.\nAdditionally, the experiment found that variations in maximum match amounts and suggested donation benchmarks did not significantly influence donor behavior. Importantly, the study identified a notable contextual effect related to political environment: donors in politically conservative (‚Äúred‚Äù) states demonstrated significantly higher responsiveness to matching offers, with an increase of 55% in revenue per solicitation, whereas minimal effects were observed in politically liberal (‚Äúblue‚Äù) states. The estimated price elasticity derived from this experiment was approximately ‚Äì0.225, aligning well with prior elasticity estimates from studies examining tax-based incentives.\nThis research provides clear implications for fundraising strategy and policy. Practitioners are advised that matching grants are effective tools, though escalating match ratios beyond a simple 1:1 offer may not be cost-effective or necessary. Moreover, the study challenges the conventional assumption that larger matching ratios inherently generate greater donor enthusiasm. Finally, the observed sensitivity to political and social context suggests that fundraisers must carefully consider these factors when crafting appeals.\nKarlan and List‚Äôs seminal findings were published in their influential paper, ‚ÄúDoes Price Matter in Charitable Giving? Evidence from a Large-Scale Natural Field Experiment,‚Äù appearing in the American Economic Review in 2007. Their supporting data are publicly accessible through the AEA Data Archive, Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), and Harvard Dataverse, facilitating further academic scrutiny and replication studies."

    "text": "Data\n\nDescription\nThe dataset compiled by Dean Karlan and John List for their 2007 field experiment comprises 50,083 observations, each corresponding to an individual who had previously donated to a U.S.-based nonprofit organization. The data were collected to evaluate the effectiveness of different fundraising appeals and include detailed information on treatment assignments, donor responses, demographic characteristics, and contextual political variables. Approximately two-thirds of the sample were assigned to a treatment group that received a fundraising letter featuring a matching grant offer, with match ratios randomly varied across 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 levels. The remaining third received a standard appeal letter and served as the control group.\nAdditional randomization was applied within the treatment group to vary the maximum matching amount ($25,000, $50,000, $100,000, or unstated) and the suggested donation amount based on the donor‚Äôs past giving behavior. The dataset includes binary indicators of whether a donation was made in response to the solicitation, the amount contributed, and the change in donation relative to previous behavior.\nFurthermore, it contains socio-demographic and contextual variables at the ZIP code level, including average household size, median household income, homeownership rate, educational attainment, and the proportion of residents in urban areas. Political context is captured through indicators of whether the respondent resided in a red or blue state or county, based on the 2004 presidential election. This rich, multi-dimensional dataset enables rigorous analysis of causal effects in charitable giving, while also allowing for the exploration of heterogeneous treatment effects across geographic, political, and demographic lines.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom scipy import stats\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\n\ndf = pd.read_stata(\"karlan_list_2007.dta\")\ndf.describe\n\n&lt;bound method NDFrame.describe of        treatment  control    ratio  ratio2  ratio3      size  size25  size50  \\\n0              0        1  Control       0       0   Control       0       0   \n1              0        1  Control       0       0   Control       0       0   \n2              1        0        1       0       0  $100,000       0       0   \n3              1        0        1       0       0  Unstated       0       0   \n4              1        0        1       0       0   $50,000       0       1   \n...          ...      ...      ...     ...     ...       ...     ...     ...   \n50078          1        0        1       0       0   $25,000       1       0   \n50079          0        1  Control       0       0   Control       0       0   \n50080          0        1  Control       0       0   Control       0       0   \n50081          1        0        3       0       1  Unstated       0       0   \n50082          1        0        3       0       1   $25,000       1       0   \n\n       size100  sizeno  ... redcty  bluecty    pwhite    pblack  page18_39  \\\n0            0       0  ...    0.0      1.0  0.446493  0.527769   0.317591   \n1            0       0  ...    1.0      0.0       NaN       NaN        NaN   \n2            1       0  ...    0.0      1.0  0.935706  0.011948   0.276128   \n3            0       1  ...    1.0      0.0  0.888331  0.010760   0.279412   \n4            0       0  ...    0.0      1.0  0.759014  0.127421   0.442389   \n...        ...     ...  ...    ...      ...       ...       ...        ...   \n50078        0       0  ...    0.0      1.0  0.872797  0.089959   0.257265   \n50079        0       0  ...    0.0      1.0  0.688262  0.108889   0.288792   \n50080        0       0  ...    1.0      0.0  0.900000  0.021311   0.178689   \n50081        0       1  ...    1.0      0.0  0.917206  0.008257   0.225619   \n50082        0       0  ...    0.0      1.0  0.530023  0.074112   0.340698   \n\n       ave_hh_sz  median_hhincome    powner  psch_atlstba  pop_propurban  \n0           2.10          28517.0  0.499807      0.324528       1.000000  \n1            NaN              NaN       NaN           NaN            NaN  \n2           2.48          51175.0  0.721941      0.192668       1.000000  \n3           2.65          79269.0  0.920431      0.412142       1.000000  \n4           1.85          40908.0  0.416072      0.439965       1.000000  \n...          ...              ...       ...           ...            ...  \n50078       2.13          45047.0  0.771316      0.263744       1.000000  \n50079       2.67          74655.0  0.741931      0.586466       1.000000  \n50080       2.36          26667.0  0.778689      0.107930       0.000000  \n50081       2.57          39530.0  0.733988      0.184768       0.634903  \n50082       3.70          48744.0  0.717843      0.127941       0.994181  \n\n[50083 rows x 51 columns]&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntreatment\nTreatment\n\n\ncontrol\nControl\n\n\nratio\nMatch ratio\n\n\nratio2\n2:1 match ratio\n\n\nratio3\n3:1 match ratio\n\n\nsize\nMatch threshold\n\n\nsize25\n$25,000 match threshold\n\n\nsize50\n$50,000 match threshold\n\n\nsize100\n$100,000 match threshold\n\n\nsizeno\nUnstated match threshold\n\n\nask\nSuggested donation amount\n\n\naskd1\nSuggested donation was highest previous contribution\n\n\naskd2\nSuggested donation was 1.25 x highest previous contribution\n\n\naskd3\nSuggested donation was 1.50 x highest previous contribution\n\n\nask1\nHighest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\nask2\n1.25 x highest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\nask3\n1.50 x highest previous contribution (for suggestion)\n\n\namount\nDollars given\n\n\ngave\nGave anything\n\n\namountchange\nChange in amount given\n\n\nhpa\nHighest previous contribution\n\n\nltmedmra\nSmall prior donor: last gift was less than median $35\n\n\nfreq\nNumber of prior donations\n\n\nyears\nNumber of years since initial donation\n\n\nyear5\nAt least 5 years since initial donation\n\n\nmrm2\nNumber of months since last donation\n\n\ndormant\nAlready donated in 2005\n\n\nfemale\nFemale\n\n\ncouple\nCouple\n\n\nstate50one\nState tag: 1 for one observation of each of 50 states;

The goal of these tests is to verify that the random assignment of fundraising letters resulted in comparable groups with respect to observable characteristics prior to treatment, thereby strengthening the causal interpretation of the experimental findings.\nThe variables selected for the balance tests closely mirror those presented in Table 1 of the original publication and encompass both donation history and demographic attributes. Specifically, we examine (1) the donor‚Äôs highest previous contribution (hpa), (2) the number of prior donations (freq), (3) the number of years since the donor‚Äôs initial contribution to the organization (years), (4) an indicator variable for female donors (female), and (5) a binary indicator for residing in a politically conservative (‚Äúred‚Äù) state as determined by support for George W. Bush in the 2004 U.S. presidential election (red0).\nWhen comparing our calculated group means to those reported in Karlan and List‚Äôs Table 1, we find a near-exact match across all variables. In our sample, the mean highest previous contribution is $59.60 for the treatment group and $58.96 for the control group‚Äîidentical to the values in the published table. Likewise, the average number of prior donations is 8.04 in the treatment group and 8.05 in the control group, with years since initial donation averaging 6.08 and 6.14, respectively. The proportion of female donors is 27.5% in the treatment group and 28.3% in the control group, while the share of donors living in red states is 40.7% versus 39.9% across the two groups. These findings confirm that the implementation of the randomization closely aligns with the authors‚Äô original execution.\nTo formally test for balance, we employed both two-sample t-tests and simple linear regressions of each covariate on the treatment assignment indicator. In all cases, the resulting p-values were above the conventional 0.05 threshold, indicating no statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups at the 95% confidence level. The closest results to marginal significance were observed for the female variable (p = 0.080 in the t-test; p = 0.079 in the regression) and the red0 variable (p = 0.060 in the t-test; p = 0.061 in the regression). While these values approach the 10% significance level, they are insufficient to suggest meaningful imbalance and instead support the interpretation that randomization achieved statistical equivalence on observed characteristics.\nThese balance checks serve a vital role in reinforcing the credibility of the experimental design. As underscored by Karlan and List in their original presentation of Table 1, demonstrating that treatment and control groups are comparable across a range of relevant baseline variables helps rule out confounding factors. Consequently, we can attribute any subsequent differences in donor behavior to the experimental treatments rather than to pre-existing group disparities."

The results, visualized in Figure 1, show that 1.79% of individuals in the control group made a donation, compared to 2.20% in the treatment group. This initial comparison suggests a positive effect of the matching grant offer on the likelihood of donating.\nTo assess the statistical significance of this difference, we conducted a two-sample t-test for proportions. The t-statistic was 3.21, with a corresponding p-value of 0.0013, indicating that the increase in donation rates among the treatment group is statistically significant at the 1% level. This result suggests that the observed difference is unlikely to be due to random chance alone.\nTo further substantiate this finding, we estimated a bivariate linear regression with a binary dependent variable indicating whether a donation was made. The treatment group indicator had a coefficient of 0.0042, which implies a 0.42 percentage point increase in donation likelihood associated with receiving a matching offer. The p-value associated with this coefficient was 0.0019, reaffirming the statistical significance of the treatment effect. The model‚Äôs R-squared value, although small (0.00019), is typical for binary outcomes in field settings and highlights that the variation in donations is largely driven by unobserved factors, as expected.\nAdditionally, we replicated the probit regression reported in Table 3, Column 1 of Karlan and List (2007), where the probability of donating was modeled as a function of treatment status. Our probit estimate of the treatment coefficient was 0.087, with a p-value of 0.0019‚Äîclosely matching the original study. This replication reinforces the original conclusion that offering a matching grant significantly increases the probability of donation.\nTaken together, these results provide robust evidence that matching grants effectively increase charitable giving, even when evaluated using conservative statistical methods. The increase, though modest in magnitude, is statistically significant and practically meaningful, particularly in the context of large-scale fundraising efforts. These findings align with the behavioral insight that individuals are more likely to give when their contributions are perceived to have enhanced impact or when social cues, such as matching gifts, signal urgency or endorsement.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\ntreatment_df = df[df['treatment'] == 1].copy()\n\ntreatment_df['ratio1'] = (treatment_df['ratio'] == 1).astype(int)\ntreatment_df['ratio2'] = (treatment_df['ratio'] == 2).astype(int)\ntreatment_df['ratio3'] = (treatment_df['ratio'] == 3).astype(int)\n\nresponse_rates = treatment_df.groupby('ratio', observed=True)['donated'].mean()\n\nt1_vs_t2 = stats.ttest_ind(\n    treatment_df[treatment_df['ratio'] == 1]['donated'],\n    treatment_df[treatment_df['ratio'] == 2]['donated'],\n    equal_var=False\n)\n\nt2_vs_t3 = stats.ttest_ind(\n    treatment_df[treatment_df['ratio'] == 2]['donated'],\n    treatment_df[treatment_df['ratio'] == 3]['donated'],\n    equal_var=False\n)\n\nX_ratios = treatment_df[['ratio1', 'ratio2', 'ratio3']]\nmodel_ratios = sm.OLS(treatment_df['donated'], X_ratios).fit()\n\ncoef_1v2 = model_ratios.params['ratio2'] - model_ratios.params['ratio1']\ncoef_2v3 = model_ratios.params['ratio3'] - model_ratios.params['ratio2']\n\nvcov = model_ratios.cov_params()\nse_1v2 = (vcov.loc['ratio1', 'ratio1'] + vcov.loc['ratio2', 'ratio2'] - 2 * vcov.loc['ratio1', 'ratio2']) ** 0.5\nse_2v3 = (vcov.loc['ratio2', 'ratio2'] + vcov.loc['ratio3', 'ratio3'] - 2 * vcov.loc['ratio2', 'ratio3']) ** 0.5\n\nresults_df = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Match Ratio': ['1:1', '2:1', '3:1'],\n    'Response Rate': [response_rates[1], response_rates[2], response_rates[3]],\n    'Regression Coefficient': [model_ratios.params['ratio1'], model_ratios.params['ratio2'], model_ratios.params['ratio3']],\n    'p-value': [model_ratios.pvalues['ratio1'], model_ratios.pvalues['ratio2'], model_ratios.pvalues['ratio3']]\n})\n\ncomparison_df = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Comparison': ['1:1 vs 2:1', '2:1 vs 3:1'],\n    'Difference in Response Rate': [response_rates[2] - response_rates[1], response_rates[3] - response_rates[2]],\n    't-statistic': [t1_vs_t2.statistic, t2_vs_t3.statistic],\n    'p-value': [t1_vs_t2.pvalue, t2_vs_t3.pvalue],\n    'Coefficient Difference': [coef_1v2, coef_2v3],\n    'Standard Error': [se_1v2, se_2v3]\n})\n\nresults_df = results_df.round(4)\ncomparison_df = comparison_df.round(4)\n\nresults_df.set_index('Match Ratio')\n\nprint(results_df)\nprint(comparison_df)\n\n  Match Ratio  Response Rate  Regression Coefficient  p-value\n0         1:1         0.0207                  0.0207      0.0\n1         2:1         0.0226                  0.0226      0.0\n2         3:1         0.0227                  0.0227      0.0\n   Comparison  Difference in Response Rate  t-statistic  p-value  \\\n0  1:1 vs 2:1                       0.0019      -0.9650   0.3345   \n1  2:1 vs 3:1                       0.0001      -0.0501   0.9600   \n\n   Coefficient Difference  Standard Error  \n0                  0.0019           0.002  \n1                  0.0001           0.002  \n\n\nTo further investigate the effectiveness of different matching grant ratios, we restricted our analysis to individuals in the treatment group and examined variation in donation rates across three matching levels: 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1. The response rates were remarkably similar across groups, with 2.07% of individuals in the 1:1 match group donating, compared to 2.26% in the 2:1 group and 2.27% in the 3:1 group. Although there is a slight upward trend in donation rates as the match ratio increases, the absolute differences are marginal‚Äîonly 0.19 and 0.01 percentage points between successive levels.\nTo assess whether these differences are statistically meaningful, we conducted a series of two-sample t-tests comparing the donation rates between match levels. The difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 groups was not statistically significant (p=0.335), nor was the difference between the 2:1 and 3:1 groups (p=0.960). These results provide no evidence that offering a higher match ratio leads to a greater likelihood of donation.\nWe corroborated these findings using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, regressing the binary donation outcome on dummy indicators for each match ratio group. The regression was specified without an intercept so that each coefficient would represent the mean response rate for its respective group. The estimated coefficients were 0.02075 for the 1:1 group, 0.02263 for the 2:1 group, and 0.02273 for the 3:1 group, all statistically significant at the 0.001 level. However, differences between these coefficients were small and statistically indistinguishable. Specifically, the difference between the 2:1 and 1:1 coefficients was 0.00188 (SE = 0.00197), and the difference between the 3:1 and 2:1 coefficients was just 0.00010 (SE = 0.00197). Neither difference is statistically significant, confirming the t-test results.\nThese findings align with Karlan and List‚Äôs original interpretation in their 2007 study. While the presence of a match clearly boosts giving relative to a control condition, increasing the match ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 or 3:1 does not generate additional giving. This suggests that the behavioral mechanism driving increased donations is not necessarily the financial leverage offered by higher match ratios, but rather the psychological or social signal conveyed by the presence of any match offer. The match may function more as a nudge or cue, reinforcing the importance or credibility of the appeal, rather than as a precise price incentive.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\n\nX_full = sm.add_constant(df['treatment'])\nmodel_full = sm.OLS(df['amount'], X_full, missing='drop').fit()\n\ndonors_df = df[df['amount'] &gt; 0].copy()\nX_donors = sm.add_constant(donors_df['treatment'])\nmodel_donors = sm.OLS(donors_df['amount'], X_donors).fit()\n\ntreatment_donors = donors_df[donors_df['treatment'] == 1]['amount']\ncontrol_donors = donors_df[donors_df['treatment'] == 0]['amount']\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nplt.hist(control_donors, bins=30, alpha=0.7, edgecolor='black')\nplt.axvline(control_donors.mean(), color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)\nplt.title('Donation Amounts: Control Group')\nplt.xlabel('Donation Amount')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\n\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nplt.hist(treatment_donors, bins=30, alpha=0.7, edgecolor='black')\nplt.axvline(treatment_donors.mean(), color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)\nplt.title('Donation Amounts: Treatment Group')\nplt.xlabel('Donation Amount')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nregression_results = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Model': ['OLS Full Sample', 'OLS Donors Only'],\n    'Coefficient': [model_full.params['treatment'], model_donors.params['treatment']],\n    'p-value': [model_full.pvalues['treatment'], model_donors.pvalues['treatment']]\n})\nregression_results.set_index('Model').round(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoefficient\np-value\n\n\nModel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOLS Full Sample\n0.154\n0.063\n\n\nOLS Donors Only\n-1.668\n0.561\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo evaluate the effect of matching grant offers on the amount donated, we conducted a series of ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions and visualized the distribution of donation amounts across treatment conditions. We first estimated a linear model using the full sample, which included both donors and non-donors. The regression specification modeled donation amount as a function of a binary treatment indicator. The estimated coefficient on the treatment variable was $0.154, with a p-value of 0.063. Although this estimate is not statistically significant at the conventional 5% level, it reaches marginal significance at the 10% level, suggesting that offering a matching grant may slightly increase overall donations by increasing participation, rather than the amount given by each donor.\nTo isolate the intensive margin, whether the treatment affected how much individuals gave once they decided to donate we ran the same regression on a restricted sample of donors only. In this case, the estimated coefficient on the treatment indicator was ‚Äì$1.67, with a p-value of 0.561. This result indicates that among those who chose to donate, individuals in the treatment group gave slightly less on average than those in the control group. However, the difference is not statistically significant, and the relatively large p-value suggests that this finding is likely attributable to random variation rather than a treatment effect.\nHistograms of donation amounts for both the control and treatment groups further illuminate the distributional patterns. As is typical in charitable giving data, both distributions are highly right-skewed, with most donors giving relatively small amounts and a few contributing substantially more. Visual inspection shows little difference between the two groups, with the average donation in each group marked by a red dashed line. The near overlap in mean values visually reinforces the regression results: while the presence of a matching offer may influence whether someone donates, it appears to have little effect on how much they give once they have made the decision to contribute.\nOverall, this analysis complements prior findings by reinforcing the notion that matching grants primarily operate on the extensive margin‚Äîthat is, increasing the likelihood of giving‚Äîrather than on the intensive margin, or the size of the gift. This distinction is important for fundraisers: while match offers can broaden donor participation, they may not significantly raise per-donor revenue among those who are already inclined to give."

These probabilities mirror the actual donation rates observed in the original field experiment. We simulated 10,000 random samples for each group across a range of increasing sample sizes‚Äîspecifically n= 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 and calculated the mean donation rates as well as t-statistics for comparing group means within each simulation iteration.\nThe results underscore key statistical principles. As sample sizes increased, the simulated group means converged to the true underlying probabilities. For instance, at n=1,000, the average simulated donation rate for the control group was 0.01800, and for the treatment group, 0.02195‚Äînearly identical to their theoretical values. The average t-statistic for n=1,000 was approximately 0.63, with a standard deviation near 0.99, indicating the t-statistic distribution was both centered and scaled appropriately, as expected under the Central Limit Theorem. In contrast, at smaller sample sizes (n=50 and n=100), the t-statistic distributions were unstable, with many values undefined or highly variable due to the small number of binary outcomes and low donation rates. These issues resulted in missing or non-informative summary statistics, highlighting the volatility of inference at small ùëõ.\nVisualizations of the t-statistics for n=500 and n=1,000 further reinforce these patterns. The histograms reveal increasingly symmetric, bell-shaped distributions as the sample size grows, with the mean of each distribution marked by a red dashed line. At n=1,000, the distribution closely approximates a standard normal curve, a hallmark of the Central Limit Theorem. The standard deviation of the t-statistic distribution also approaches 1, which is consistent with theoretical expectations for standardized test statistics under the null hypothesis.\nThese results demonstrate how both the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem manifest in practice. As sample sizes grow, sample means become more accurate estimates of the population parameters (convergence in probability), and the sampling distribution of test statistics approaches a normal distribution, enabling valid inference using tools like the t-test. Conversely, in small samples, randomness dominates, increasing the likelihood of erratic or misleading results. This simulation thus reinforces the importance of sufficient sample size in experimental design and statistical inference‚Äîespecially when working with low-probability binary outcomes, such as charitable giving.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\n\nnp.random.seed(42)\ncontrol_draws = np.random.binomial(1, 0.018, size=100000)\ntreatment_draws = np.random.binomial(1, 0.022, size=10000)\n\ncontrol_draws_subset = control_draws[:10000]\n\ndiff_vector = treatment_draws - control_draws_subset\n\ncumulative_avg_diff = np.cumsum(diff_vector) / np.arange(1, len(diff_vector) + 1)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\nplt.plot(cumulative_avg_diff, label='Cumulative Average of Differences')\nplt.axhline(y=0.022 - 0.018, color='red', linestyle='--', label='True Mean Difference (0.004)')\nplt.title('Law of Large Numbers: Cumulative Average of Differences')\nplt.xlabel('Number of Simulated Observations')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Average')\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo visually demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) in the context of donation behavior, we simulated binary donation outcomes from two Bernoulli distributions. Specifically, we generated 100,000 independent draws from a control group distribution with a probability of success p=0.018 and 10,000 draws from a treatment group distribution with p=0.022. We then computed the difference between each of the first 10,000 matched treatment and control observations and tracked the cumulative average of these differences across the sample. This cumulative average was plotted against the number of simulated observations, with a red dashed line indicating the true mean difference between the two groups (0.022 ‚àí 0.018 = 0.004).\nThe resulting graph illustrates the fundamental property of the LLN. In the early stages of the simulation, the cumulative average of differences fluctuates substantially, reflecting the volatility inherent in small samples. However, as more observations are included, the cumulative average begins to stabilize and gradually converges toward the true population difference of 0.004. This convergence visually affirms the core prediction of the LLN: as the number of independent and identically distributed trials increases, the sample average tends to approach the expected value.\nThis simulation effectively contextualizes the LLN using a real-world experimental design and underscores why statistical inference becomes more reliable with larger sample sizes. By showing how the empirical difference in donation behavior becomes increasingly stable and reflective of the underlying population parameters, the simulation reinforces both the theoretical importance and practical implications of the LLN in experimental economics and applied statistics.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\nn_replications = 1000\np_control = 0.018\np_treatment = 0.022\n\nmean_diffs_by_n = {}\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 8))\n\nfor i, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    mean_diffs = []\n    for _ in range(n_replications):\n        control_sample = np.random.binomial(1, p_control, size=n)\n        treatment_sample = np.random.binomial(1, p_treatment, size=n)\n        mean_diff = treatment_sample.mean() - control_sample.mean()\n        mean_diffs.append(mean_diff)\n    \n    mean_diffs_by_n[n] = mean_diffs\n    \n    ax = axs[i // 2, i % 2]\n    ax.hist(mean_diffs, bins=30, edgecolor='black', alpha=0.7, density=True)\n    ax.axvline(x=np.mean(mean_diffs), color='red', linestyle='--', label='Mean Difference')\n    ax.axvline(x=0, color='black', linestyle=':', label='Zero')\n    ax.set_title(f'Sample Size = {n}')\n    ax.set_xlabel('Average Difference (Treatment - Control)')\n    ax.set_ylabel('Density')\n    ax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in the context of experimental data on charitable giving, we conducted a simulation comparing average donation rates between control and treatment groups drawn from Bernoulli distributions. Specifically, we simulated 1,000 replications at each of four different sample sizes n=50, 200, 500, and 1,000‚Äî sing control group probabilities of p=0.018 and treatment group probabilities of p=0.022. In each replication, we calculated the difference in sample means (treatment minus control), resulting in distributions of 1,000 average differences for each sample size.\nThe histograms of these average differences provide compelling visual evidence for the CLT. At n=50, the distribution is jagged and displays high variability. The value of zero, which represents the null hypothesis of no treatment effect, appears near the center of the distribution due to this noise. At n=200, the distribution becomes more symmetric and begins to resemble a bell-shaped curve, while the sampling mean visibly approaches the true population difference of 0.004. By n=500 and ùëõ=1,000, the distributions exhibit the hallmark shape of the normal distribution: smooth, symmetric, and tightly centered around the expected mean. In these larger samples, the value of zero lies clearly in the tail of the distribution, suggesting that a t-test would likely reject the null hypothesis in favor of a statistically significant treatment effect.\nThese results vividly demonstrate the predictive power of the CLT. As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means converges in shape to the normal distribution, even though the underlying data are binary. This convergence underpins the validity of inferential tools such as the t-test and confidence intervals in empirical work. It also highlights why larger sample sizes enhance statistical power and reduce the risk of Type II error. In sum, this simulation confirms that even in experiments involving binary outcomes like donation behavior, standard statistical inference remains appropriate and robust when sample sizes are sufficiently large."

While private giving in the U.S. has historically been robust‚Äîoften exceeding 2% of GDP‚Äîfundraisers have long relied on anecdotes and rules of thumb rather than scientific evidence to guide their strategies. \n\n# To bring empirical clarity to this issue, economists **Dean Karlan** (Yale University) and **John List** (University of Chicago) conducted a landmark field experiment to investigate whether and how the *\"price\"* of giving affects charitable donations.\n\n# The study focused on understanding the *demand side* of charitable giving, which is less studied compared to the tax-incentivized *supply side*. Specifically, the researchers wanted to examine whether offering *matching grants*‚Äîwhere donations are matched by a lead donor‚Äîwould increase contributions.\n\n# ### Research Question\n\n# &gt; Does reducing the \"price\" of charitable giving through matching grants increase donations?\n\n# ---\n\n# ## Experimental Design and Methodology\n\n# The experiment was conducted in collaboration with a U.S.-based liberal nonprofit organization. The sample consisted of **50,083 prior donors**, randomly divided into two groups:\n\n# - A **control group** (~33%) received a standard four-page fundraising letter.\n# - A **treatment group** (~67%) received a similar letter with the inclusion of a **matching grant offer**.\n\n# ### Sub-Treatments within the Treatment Group\n\n# Recipients in the treatment group were further randomly assigned to one of several sub-conditions:\n\n# 1. **Matching Ratios**:\n#     - \\(1:1\\) ‚Äî For every \\$1 donated, the donor matched \\$1.\n#     - \\(2:1\\) ‚Äî For every \\$1 donated, the donor matched \\$2.\n#     - \\(3:1\\) ‚Äî For every \\$1 donated, the donor matched \\$3.\n\n# 2. **Maximum Match Amounts**:\n#     - \\$25,000  \n#     - \\$50,000  \n#     - \\$100,000  \n#     - Unspecified cap\n\n# 3. **Suggested Donation Examples** (based on past donation amounts):\n#     - 100% (same as highest previous contribution)\n#     - 125%\n#     - 150%\n\n# All letters were sent in **August 2005**, referencing a real-time political event (Supreme Court nominations), ensuring external validity through real financial stakes.\n\n# ---\n\n# ## Key Findings and Results\n\n# ### Matching Grant Effectiveness\n\n# - Simply **offering a match** increased:\n#   - **Response rate** by **22%**\n#   - **Revenue per solicitation** by **19%**\n\n# - **Higher match ratios** (\\(2:1\\), \\(3:1\\)) provided **no additional benefit** compared to \\(1:1\\).\n  \n# ### Behavioral Interpretations\n\n# - Matching offers likely served as a **signal of credibility and urgency**.\n# - Donors may have been influenced by **social cues** embedded in the match framing.\n\n# ### Other Insights\n\n# - **Cap size** and **suggested amount examples** showed no strong influence.\n# - **Political environment** mattered:\n#   - The **match offer increased donations significantly in red states** (+55% revenue per solicitation).\n#   - Minimal effect observed in blue states.\n  \n# ### Elasticity Estimate\n\n# - Estimated **price elasticity**:  \n#   \\[\n#   \\varepsilon \\approx -0.225\n#   \\]  \n#   This falls within the range of prior estimates derived from tax-based price effects.\n\n# ---\n\n# ## Implications\n\n# - Fundraisers **should use matching grants**, but **do not need to escalate the match ratio** for additional benefit.\n# - The experiment questions the assumption that *larger matches are always more persuasive*.\n# - Political and social context can significantly mediate the effectiveness of fundraising appeals.\n# - The results also inform broader public policy discussions around **cost-benefit analysis** and **valuation of public goods**.\n\n# ---\n\n# ## Publication and Data Access\n\n# The results of this study were published in:\n\n# &gt; **Karlan, Dean and John A.

These include donor history, demographics, and political geography.\nVariables Tested\nWe test the following five variables:\n\n ‚Äì Highest previous contribution\n\n ‚Äì Number of prior donations\n\n ‚Äì Number of years since initial donation\n\n ‚Äì Indicator for female donor\n\n ‚Äì Indicator for living in a red (Bush 2004) state\n\nComparison with Table 1 from the Paper\nStatistical Test Results\nEach variable was tested for balance using both a two-sample t-test and a linear regression of the variable on the treatment indicator. All p-values exceeded 0.05, indicating no statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups at the 95% confidence level.\nNotably:\n\n: p = 0.080 (t-test), p = 0.079 (regression)\n\n: p = 0.060 (t-test), p = 0.061 (regression)\n\nThese are close to significance at the 10% level but still support the assumption of balance.\nCommentary\nTable 1 is included in the original paper as a critical validation of the randomization strategy. Demonstrating statistical equivalence across treatment and control groups for observable characteristics helps establish that any observed treatment effects on outcomes are causally attributable to the experimental manipulation rather than pre-existing differences. Our balance test results confirm this, providing additional support for the credibility of the experimental design.\n\n\nExperimental Results\nCharitable Contribution Made\n\n# Step 1: Create binary donation variable\ndf['donated'] = df['gave'].fillna(0)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate donation proportions\ndonation_rates = df.groupby('treatment')['donated'].mean()\n\n# Plotting\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nsns.barplot(x=donation_rates.index, y=donation_rates.values)\nplt.xticks([0, 1], ['Control', 'Treatment'])\nplt.ylabel('Proportion Who Donated')\nplt.title('Donation Rates by Treatment Group')\nplt.ylim(0, max(donation_rates.values) * 1.2)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.grid(axis='y')\nplt.show()\n\n# Step 3: T-test for donation rates\ntreatment_don = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['donated']\ncontrol_don = df[df['treatment'] == 0]['donated']\nt_stat, p_val = stats.ttest_ind(treatment_don, control_don, equal_var=False)\n\n# Step 4: Bivariate linear regression\nX_lin = sm.add_constant(df['treatment'])\nmodel_lin = sm.OLS(df['donated'], X_lin).fit()\n\n# Step 5: Probit regression\nmodel_probit = sm.Probit(df['donated'], X_lin).fit(disp=0)\n\n# Collect and return all results\n{\n    \"Donation Rates\": donation_rates.to_dict(),\n    \"T-test\": {\n        \"t_statistic\": t_stat,\n        \"p_value\": p_val\n    },\n    \"Linear Regression\": {\n        \"coefficient\": model_lin.params['treatment'],\n        \"p_value\": model_lin.pvalues['treatment'],\n        \"r_squared\": model_lin.rsquared\n    },\n    \"Probit Regression (Table 3 Col 1)\": {\n        \"coefficient\": model_probit.params['treatment'],\n        \"p_value\": model_probit.pvalues['treatment']\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{'Donation Rates': {0: 0.017858212980164198, 1: 0.02203856749311295},\n 'T-test': {'t_statistic': np.float64(3.2094621908279835),\n  'p_value': np.float64(0.0013309823450914173)},\n 'Linear Regression': {'coefficient': np.float64(0.004180354512949392),\n  'p_value': np.float64(0.0019274025949017077),\n  'r_squared': np.float64(0.00019202078862623484)},\n 'Probit Regression (Table 3 Col 1)': {'coefficient': np.float64(0.08678462244745834),\n  'p_value': np.float64(0.0018523990147882028)}}\n\n\n\n# ## üéØ Analysis: Effect of Matched Donations on Charitable Giving\n\n# ### üìä Barplot ‚Äì Donation Rates by Group\n\n# The barplot shows:\n\n# \\begin{itemize}\n#   \\item \\textbf{Control Group:} Approximately 1.79\\% of individuals donated\n#   \\item \\textbf{Treatment Group:} Approximately 2.20\\% of individuals donated\n# \\end{itemize}\n\n# This simple visual confirms that a higher proportion of people donated when offered a matching grant.\n\n# ---\n\n# ### üî¨ Statistical Tests\n\n# #### ‚úÖ T-test\n\n# \\begin{itemize}\n#   \\item \\textbf{Result:} The difference in donation rates is statistically significant (\\( p = 0.0013 \\))\n#   \\item \\textbf{Interpretation:} There is strong evidence that the treatment group donated more than the control group, even after accounting for natural variation.\n# \\end{itemize}\n\n# ---\n\n# #### ‚úÖ Linear Regression\n\n# \\begin{itemize}\n#   \\item \\textbf{Model:} \\texttt{donated} $\\sim$ \\texttt{treatment\\_group}\n#   \\item \\textbf{Coefficient on treatment:} 0.0042 (i.e., a 0.42 percentage point increase in donation rate)\n#   \\item \\textbf{P-value:} 0.0019\n#   \\item \\textbf{Interpretation:} The regression confirms the same result ‚Äî a small but statistically significant increase in the likelihood of giving due to the matching grant.\n# \\end{itemize}\n\n# ---\n\n# #### ‚úÖ Probit Regression (Replicating Table 3, Column 1)\n\n# \\begin{itemize}\n#   \\item \\textbf{Coefficient on treatment:} 0.087\n#   \\item \\textbf{P-value:} 0.0019\n# \\end{itemize}\n\n# This closely matches Table 3, Column 1 in the original paper, where the treatment effect is also reported as statistically significant and positive.\n\n# ---\n\n# ### üß† Conclusion\n\n# These results suggest that offering a matching grant increases the probability of charitable giving. Even though the increase is modest, it is statistically significant and practically relevant for large-scale fundraising. This finding supports the notion that people are more likely to give when their donations are perceived to have more impact or when they feel socially encouraged to act.\n\n\n# ## Replication of Table 3, Column 1 (Probit Regression)\n\n# To assess whether our replication matches the findings in Karlan and List (2007), we estimated a probit regression where the dependent variable is a binary indicator for whether a charitable donation was made, and the explanatory variable is a treatment group indicator.\n\n# ### Model Specification\n# \\[\n# \\text{Pr}(\\text{donated}_i = 1) = \\Phi(\\alpha + \\beta \\cdot \\text{treatment}_i)\n# \\]\n\n# Where:\n# - \\(\\Phi\\) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution\n# - \\(\\text{treatment}_i = 1\\) if individual \\(i\\) received any matching grant offer\n# - \\(\\text{donated}_i = 1\\) if individual \\(i\\) made any charitable donation\n\n# ### Results\n\n# \\begin{table}[h!]\n# \\centering\n# \\begin{tabular}{lcc}\n# \\toprule\n# \\textbf{Variable} & \\textbf{Coefficient} & \\textbf{p-value} \\\\\n# \\midrule\n# Treatment Indicator & 0.087 & 0.0019 \\\\\n# \\bottomrule\n# \\end{tabular}\n# \\caption{Probit regression replicating Table 3, Column 1 of Karlan \\& List (2007)}\n# \\end{table}\n\n# ### Interpretation\n\n# Our estimated coefficient of \\(\\beta = 0.087\\) and associated p-value closely match the published results in Table 3, Column 1 of the original paper. This confirms the authors‚Äô key finding: assignment to the treatment group (receiving a matching grant offer) significantly increased the likelihood of making a donation.\n\n# The positive and statistically significant coefficient implies that simply offering a matching gift makes people more likely to give, even if the size of the match or other conditions vary.

While private giving in the U.S. has historically been robust‚Äîoften exceeding 2% of GDP‚Äîfundraisers have long relied on anecdotes and rules of thumb rather than scientific evidence to guide their strategies.\nTo bring empirical clarity to this issue, economists Dean Karlan (Yale University) and John List (University of Chicago) conducted a landmark field experiment to investigate whether and how the ‚Äúprice‚Äù of giving affects charitable donations.\nThe study focused on understanding the demand side of charitable giving, which is less studied compared to the tax-incentivized supply side. Specifically, the researchers wanted to examine whether offering matching grants‚Äîwhere donations are matched by a lead donor‚Äîwould increase contributions.\n\nResearch Question\n\nDoes reducing the ‚Äúprice‚Äù of charitable giving through matching grants increase donations?"
